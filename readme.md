# Hi There!
Welcome to your interview. This is designed to be a fun experience that shows me your habits and comfort with general software tools. Please accomplish the following tasks:

- make a local clone of this repo
- create a branch called 'my-answers'
- answer the questions in `questions.py` to the best of your ability (not a huge deal if there are minor errors or edge cases)
- run the pytest unit tests in `test.py`
- if you're happy with the results, push the branch to origin and submit a pull request on github.
